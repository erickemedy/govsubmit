        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: December 21, 2025</p>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>GovSubmit.com ("we," "us," or "our") is an independent civic tool designed to help users prepare and submit reports to official government agencies. We are not a government website and are not affiliated with any government agency. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect the information you voluntarily enter into our guided wizards, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number, complaint details, and other information you choose to provide in order to prepare a report.</p>
        <p>If you grant location access, your browser may provide approximate location data (e.g., latitude and longitude) so we can identify relevant local services (such as 311, local police non-emergency reporting, state Attorneys General, or election offices).</p>
        <p>Like most websites, our servers may receive basic technical information automatically, such as IP address, browser type, device information, the date and time of your request, and the page you visited.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information you enter exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Guide you through preparing your report.</li>
            <li>Pre-fill fields where possible.</li>
            <li>Redirect or link you to the official government portals (for example, FCC, CISA, local 311, FTC, EPA, or state agencies) so you can complete and submit your complaint directly on those sites.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Location data is used only to identify relevant local or state services and to construct search links for your jurisdiction. If you do not want to share location, you can deny the request and use the manual search guidance provided.</p>

        <h2>No Permanent Storage of Complaint Details</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not intentionally store the personal complaint details you enter (such as your narrative, contact information, or incident description) in a persistent database on our servers.</strong> Those details are handled in your browser to prepare links or pre-filled forms to official government websites.</p>
        <p>However, like any web service, our servers may retain limited, transient technical logs (for example, IP address, user agent, time of access, and requested URL) for security, performance, and abuse-prevention purposes. These logs do not contain the full contents of your complaint wizards.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We rely on a small number of third-party services to operate GovSubmit.com. When you use these features, certain limited data may be sent to those providers, and their own privacy policies will apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mapping / Geocoding (OpenStreetMap Nominatim or similar):</strong> If you grant location access, your approximate coordinates may be sent from your browser to a third-party geocoding service (such as OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim API) to determine your city and state and help locate the appropriate local portals. That service may log requests and IP addresses according to its own policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Donations (Ko-fi):</strong> If you click our Ko-fi donation button, you will interact with Ko-fi, which may use cookies or similar technologies and collect personal and payment information according to its own terms and privacy policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you follow links or are redirected to government or other external sites (for example, FCC, CISA, FTC, EPA, local 311 portals, state Attorneys General, or election offices), those sites are outside our control and are governed by their own privacy and security practices.</p>

        <h2>Cookies, Local Storage, and Analytics</h2>
        <p>We do not use third-party advertising trackers or analytics tools such as Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>We may use limited browser storage technologies, such as LocalStorage, to keep simple usage statistics (for example, counts of how many times a wizard is opened) on your device. These statistics are stored locally in your browser and are not transmitted to our servers as user profiles.</p>
        <p>Embedded third-party services, such as Ko-fi, may set cookies or similar identifiers when you interact with them. You can manage or delete cookies using your browser settings.</p>

        <h2>How Complaints Are Submitted</h2>
        <p>GovSubmit.com does not submit complaints to government agencies on your behalf. Instead, we help you prepare information and then send you to official government websites (for example, the FCC’s Consumer Complaint Center or CISA’s incident reporting form) where you review, complete, and submit your complaint directly.</p>
        <p>Your relationship (including any data you provide) with those government or third-party sites is governed by their own terms of use and privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>GovSubmit.com uses HTTPS encryption for all connections to reduce the risk of interception in transit. However, no online service is completely secure. Please consider the sensitivity of the information you share and use your best judgment when using any online reporting tool.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Because we do not maintain user accounts or store your complaint details in a persistent database, we generally cannot identify or retrieve specific complaints or narratives entered through the site after you leave.</p>
        <p>You can choose what information to enter, whether to grant location access, and whether to use donation features or other third-party services. You may also manage cookies and site data via your browser settings.</p>
        <p>Depending on where you live (for example, California under the CCPA or the European Union under the GDPR), you may have additional rights. If you contact us with a privacy-related request, we will do our best to assist where applicable and technically feasible.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can address the issue.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the site after changes take effect means you agree to the updated policy.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
